**Description**

Just like the Dex one, we are asked to drain tokens, but this time both tokens are required to pass this level. One thing to note is that the swap function was updated. Let's look at the code:

- **DexTwo.sol**
```solidity=
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "openzeppelin-contracts-08/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";
import "openzeppelin-contracts-08/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
import 'openzeppelin-contracts-08/access/Ownable.sol';

contract DexTwo is Ownable {
  address public token1;
  address public token2;
  constructor() {}

  function setTokens(address _token1, address _token2) public onlyOwner {
    token1 = _token1;
    token2 = _token2;
  }

  function add_liquidity(address token_address, uint amount) public onlyOwner {
    IERC20(token_address).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
  }

  function swap(address from, address to, uint amount) public {
    require(IERC20(from).balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amount, "Not enough to swap");
    uint swapAmount = getSwapAmount(from, to, amount);
    IERC20(from).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    IERC20(to).approve(address(this), swapAmount);
    IERC20(to).transferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, swapAmount);
  }

  function getSwapAmount(address from, address to, uint amount) public view returns(uint){
    return((amount * IERC20(to).balanceOf(address(this)))/IERC20(from).balanceOf(address(this)));
  }

  function approve(address spender, uint amount) public {
    SwappableTokenTwo(token1).approve(msg.sender, spender, amount);
    SwappableTokenTwo(token2).approve(msg.sender, spender, amount);
  }

  function balanceOf(address token, address account) public view returns (uint){
    return IERC20(token).balanceOf(account);
  }
}

contract SwappableTokenTwo is ERC20 {
  address private _dex;
  constructor(address dexInstance, string memory name, string memory symbol, uint initialSupply) ERC20(name, symbol) {
        _mint(msg.sender, initialSupply);
        _dex = dexInstance;
  }

  function approve(address owner, address spender, uint256 amount) public {
    require(owner != _dex, "InvalidApprover");
    super._approve(owner, spender, amount);
  }
}
```

As we can see, the `swap` function now lacks the check to see if the tokens are the same that the contract is using. Now this is easier to break since we can just implement our own tokens and mint whatever value we want to give to the user and get all the tokens for ourselves.

**Recommendation**

As we can see, in addition to the recommendation from DEX one it is recommended to check ifÂ  `from` and `to` arguments match `token1` and `token2`.
